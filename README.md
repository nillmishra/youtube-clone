# youtube-clone
A YouTube clone using HTML and CSS is a simplified web page that mimics the visual design and layout of the YouTube video streaming platform. It typically includes elements like a header with a logo and search bar, a navigation sidebar, a video player, and a list of video thumbnails. HTML is used to structure the page's content, while CSS is employed to style and position elements to resemble the familiar YouTube interface. However, it's important to note that such a clone would lack the actual functionality and database-backed features of the real YouTube platform, such as video uploads, comments, and user accounts.
